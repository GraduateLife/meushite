Some useful links for developers, to avoid terrible frontend codes.

## UI

Does anyone not know about shadcn/ui? To be honest this guy saves everyone's life :).
However, shadcn is too atomic, it's not easy to use it as a full-fledged UI.

- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

The following ui libraries are based on shadcn, but are more like normal ui libraries for developers.

- [Origin UI](https://originui.com/)
- [Magic UI](https://www.magicui.dev/)
- [Aceternity UI](https://www.aceternity.com/) <-this website uses it, a lot

other recommended ui libraries, i,e, not based on shadcn

- [Next UI](https://nextui.org/)<- not related to nextjs
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)

## Icons

- [Iconify](https://iconify.design/)
- [Tabler](https://tabler.io/icons) <-I prefer this one
- [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.com/)
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) <-integrated with shadcn/ui
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) <- once popular, but now I don't use it anymore

## Other annoying stuffs

- [ico converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)
- [favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- [looking for brand logos](https://seeklogo.com/)
- [make logo](https://logo.com/)

## React hooks

I just recommend this one, because I don't like to write the same codes over and over again.

- [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use)

I guess these are the all the things for frontend developers.
As for backend developers...

- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
